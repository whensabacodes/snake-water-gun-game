# Snake Water Gun Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic "Snake Water Gun" game using JavaScript. In this game, the player chooses one of three options: snake, water, or gun, and then plays against the computer. A simple set of rules determines the outcome:

- Snake drinks water

- Water destroys gun

The game is played in the browser, making it easy to play and enjoy without any additional setup. It's a fun way to pass the time and test your luck!
